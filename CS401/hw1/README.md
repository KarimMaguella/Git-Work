# Assignment One: Machine Learning in the Press

This assignment is to turn in (on Moodle) a half-dozen-ish
descriptions of machine learning related stories that appeared in the
popular Press. For example, something about a face recognition system
used by police in Detroit being inaccurate. Or a description of
Alpha Go's match against the human world champion Go player.

Each should be a plain ASCII file (utf8 if you really must use odd
characters), in the precise format below. It is divided into sections
each of which starts with a line that begins with `== ` and then the
name of the section and then the end of the line. Please do not make
up your own section types or change their order.

Be aware that we will be using these as data for a future assignment,
so please don't put in anything you wouldn't want shared with the rest
of the class in these. Do not include your name—I'll get that
automatically from Moodle.

Since other people in the class will be reading them in the course of
processing them, please take a bit of pride to make them interesting
and informative. But also, please don't go nuts! This is meant to be
fun, and to get you looking at stories about machine learning (aka AI
these days) in the press with a critical eye.

## Deadline: **17:00 Sun 16-Oct-2022**.

## Format
```
== SOURCE

The source of this story, preferably in the form of a URL

== AGENT

Who did this machine-learning-related work (e.g., Netflix)

== GOAL

What were they trying to accomplish?

== DATA

What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?

== METHODS

What methods (algorithms, etc) did they use? Supervised? Unsupervised? RL?

== RESULTS

What were their results?

== ISSUES

What issues do you see with the work (if any)? Technical problem,
ethical issues, honesty in reporting the results, etc.

== SCORE

A single digit, 1-9, alone on a single line, which is your personal
opinion of how cool this was on, with 1 being least cool and 9 most cool.

== COMMENTS

Your comments on this: did you think it was interesting and why, would
you have done it differently, was the reporting in the Press
reasonable or did they get lots of stuff wrong, etc. Was the method new,
or was it interesting new data, or an interesting new way of using existing
data and methods?
